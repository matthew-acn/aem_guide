Verifying Build in AEM
---
---

1. Navigate to the webage that is hosting your instance of AEM.
2. On localhost:4502, click **Sites**.
3. Confirm the creation of your new AEM site on the right panel.
4. Click the name of your site and the following panels until you see **en**.
5. Click the box to the left of **en** but *NOT* the *en* with the dropdown icon.
6. A new tab will appear with an option bar at the top of the screen. Click **Edit**.

Once the page loads, it should look quite similar to the screenshot below:

Now, this section of the tutorial was initially meant to demonstrate how to build out a few basic components. However, the authors of this guide have come to a concensus that your journey here must come to an end and continue onward within the official vendor [documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/developing/home.html?lang=en). As now you have been armed with the tools to establish a proper AEM development environment... and what waits you now is the amalgamation of your inborn, *intrinsic creativty*  with your budding, *technical understanding* of Adobe's CMS platform. Go forth and code!! ðŸ”¥
